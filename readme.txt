Include Google maps in posts and pages, and map posts and pages on global maps. Makes WordPress into a GeoCMS.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to include Google maps in WordPress posts and pages, and
map posts and pages on global maps.

= Alert =

If you are running MySql 4, please wait for version 1.2.1 before upgrading. It should be out soon.

= Features =

The number of features has grown beyond the limits of a short list. If you need
features that are aren't listed here, check the documentation and the Tag
Reference. Some popular features are:

* Once you have a [Google Maps API key](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html), 
  you're ready to put maps just about anywhere in your blog.

* Global maps can present your posts in many ways

	They can show just one category, for example

	Context-sensitive template maps show the markers of currently displayed posts

	Clicking on a post marker shows a customizable summary of the post or page in an info window 

* A small search map on the post editing page lets you easily add location to posts

* Location can also be embedded in post content for mobile blogging

* Support for both standard WordPress shortcodes and template tags to add maps to your site.

* GeoRSS automatically added to feeds

* Attach KML files to posts and pages

* Connect category markers with a colored line

* Many more [enhancement requests](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-geo-mashup/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=type:Enhancement&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary) 
  implemented and underway.

= New Features = 

There are often two versions of the plugin available, stable and beta. The beta
version includes all the stable version features, and also new features that
need further testing. See the current 
[Beta Documentation](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-geo-mashup/wiki/BetaDocumentation)
for more.

= Mashup Ingredients =

Geo Mashup combines WordPress, [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com), and [GeoNames](http://geonames.org) 
to create a GeoCMS that puts you in control of all your content, including geographic data.

= The Future =

I would like to make WordPress a first-class GeoCMS, and also make working with
maps in your blog as easy as working with images.

Geo Mashup has made it this far on the [customization work](http://www.cyberhobo.net/money) 
and [donations](http://www.cyberhobo.net/downloads/geo-mashup-plugin) it has
brought my way. As a freelance web developer I spend time on Geo Mashup when I
can, and look for work elsewhere when I must.
