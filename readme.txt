Include Google maps in posts and pages, and map posts and pages on global maps. Mapping with KML attachments supported.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to include Google maps in WordPress posts and pages, and
map posts and pages on global maps.

There are often two versions of the plugin available, stable and BETA. The BETA
version includes all the stable version features, and also new features that
need further testing. Look for BETA releases in the [project downloads](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-geo-mashup/downloads/list).

= Stable Features =

Geo Mashup now has quite a few options. If your needs are simple, odds are you
can leave most of the settings alone. If you need features that are aren't
listed here, check [the documentation](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-geo-mashup/wiki/Documentation).

The main features are:

* Once you have a [Google Maps API key](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html), 
  you're ready to put maps just about anywhere in your blog.

* Global maps can present your posts in many ways:

	They can show just one category, for example

	Context-sensitive template maps show the markers of currently displayed posts

	Clicking on a post marker shows a summary of the post or page in an info bubble

* A small search map on the post editing page lets you easily add location to posts

* Support for both standard WordPress [shortcodes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) and 
  [template tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters) to add maps 
  to your site.

* GeoRSS automatically added to feeds

* Attach KML files to posts and pages

* Assign colors to categories

* Connect category markers with a line

* Many more [enhancement requests](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-geo-mashup/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=type:Enhancement&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary) 
  implemented and underway.

= The Future =
I would like to make working with maps in your blog as easy as working with images. I probably will not be able to accomplish this unless I can earn some income from it. It will remain open source in any case, but future development will depend on my funds. Please [donate to the project](http://www.cyberhobo.net/downloads/geo-mashup-plugin/) if you would like to see it continue.

== Installation ==
