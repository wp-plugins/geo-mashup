Plots your posts on a master Google map with summaries in the info window, and
other mapping functions.

== Description ==

A map page presents a single Google Map representation of your blog. It can
show all posts with coordinates, or one category at a time. Each post marker's
pop-up balloon window contains a summary of the post. The entire post can
optionally be displayed on the map page.

 * There's a powerful map search admin interface for adding location to posts
 * GeoRSS is added to your feeds
 * For an example, see [my hobomap](http://www.cyberhobo.net/hobomap).
